            Team NoktaParantez was founded as a subdivision of our school's
            computer science and robotics club, HisarCS, which was established
            in 2010 but joined FIRST in 2017. Our aim is to carry on the club's
            past experiences from national and international competitions,
            fairs, and events and to participate at the FIRST Robotics
            Competition.

            School located in Istanbul, Turkey.

            Our first and foremost mission and vision is to dedicate ourselves
            to the path of learning, experiencing the STEAM and entrepreneurship
            fields while sharing our increasing knowledge on these topics with
            others to create a more equal and auspicious future for generations

            participate in the First Robotics Competition.

                When welcoming new members to our team, we don't search for
                specific qualities in students. Our team is open to all students
                who want to improve their knowledge on a variety of topics,
                learn how to work as a team, and experience every aspect of
                creating a new product and marketing. However, for the 202
                Season, when adding new participants to the team, participants's
                responses to a Google Form were considered. The form included
                questions about the interest in FRC, the responsibilities and
                the missions of a team member and the participant's experience
                in the previous years. The training of the team members is
                determined by themselves and their mentors. We believe that all
                of these processes are necessary to create assisting students
                and members who contribute to our team.

                In our CS department, there are plenty of different projects,

                wants to improve themselves in the fields of CS, STEM,
                entrepreneurship or design, they are always welcomed to ideaLab
                to participate in different activities.

          <span>This section is a short overview of our future plans.</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Our main plan for the future, besides improving ourselves and
            furthering our accomplishments as a team, is to impart this
            accumulation of information we hold onto the disadvantaged so that
            we can close this deplorable gaps between socioeconomic groups and
            genders, which is highly palpable in our country. We plan to
            accomplish this by doing several things, many of which we have
            already started.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            One of these things is to launch and mentor Jr. FLL, FLL, FTC and
            FRC teams in our community. Our specific aim for now is 1 Jr. FLL, 1
            FLL, and 1 FRC team, which we are making progress to achieve seeing
            as that we have launched and are currently mentoring 1 Jr. FLL and 1
            FLL teams. We plan on openining up our FabLab to other teams who
            need the resources. Another goal we hold is to launch robotic labs
            in the nearest two public schools in our community. We have
            contacted one of the schools and we are trying to set up a meeting
            for us to meet the kids.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In these labs, NoktaParantez members will give robotics related
            lectures to students who choose to participate. We wish to prepare
            the course details with the help of our middle school teachers in
            Hisar School. It will be administered by the said group of
            NoktaParantez members and will oversee free classes and workshops
            for the public, and seminars to attract attention to these classes
            and raise awareness of STEAM and entrepreneurship, discriminatory
            behavior within these fields due to gender and socioeconomic
            situations, as well as FIRST spirit and values amongst our
            community.

              Even though they graduate, we are in contact with them via Skype
              or by mail. We get their opinion on most of the things we do.
              Mainly, our Alumni is majoring in Mechanics and Programming. Most
              of our alumni think that FIRST and FRC have taught them different
              things and revealed features that they did not know.

              “FRC gave me a platform to convert my ideas into physical robots.
              FRC was not a purpose, but an excellent tool for me to get
              familiar with the equipment and process around me as well as how
              to use them. With FRC, I had the opportunity to work with all
              subdivision of building a robot such as electronics, mechanics,
              and computer science. By exploring these different aspects of
              robotics, I developed a passion for building robots. In fact, this
              passion led me to study Robotics Engineering at Worcester
              Polytechnic Institute. FIRST did not only improved my technical
              skills, but it also improved my presentation skills. Unless you
              can market your product well to others, your product may not be as
              successful as intended. -Zeynep Şeker- Worcester Polytechnic

              Our students who attend and host a variety of national and
              international projects, conferences and hackatons, have the
              opportunity to discover their own potential and dreams. The FRC
              also makes a great contribution to our students in their
              university life. While they continue their education in selected
              universities in the topic of STEAM such as MIT, Carnegie Mellon,
              Princeton, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Institute
              of Technology, Imperial College, Johns Hopkins, UCLA, UC Berkeley,
              University of Illinois Northwestern, Purdue University, and
              University Of Worcester, they benefit from the portfolios and
              their experience that they created in FRC. Our graduates continue
              their connections with the team and support our students in
              different kinds of projects with their mentoring skills.
